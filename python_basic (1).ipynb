        "   \n",
        "   Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It’s designed to be easy to read and write, with a syntax that feels almost like plain English. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",

        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " -  An interpreter takes the Python code you write and runs it directly, one line at a time, instead of compiling it into a full program before running it.\n",

        " - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names\n",
        "\n",
        " - Keywords are special, reserved words in a programming language that have predefined meanings and uses. Because they are part of the language's syntax, using them as variable names would cause syntax errors or unexpected behavior.\n",
